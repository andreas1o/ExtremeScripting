This workflow read the XIQ-SE Control end system table and use the IP address and hostname if given. Than try to do a DNS reverse lookup against the IP address. If a hostname determined, it will be written down to the switch port as alias used for this authentication. This workflow applies only to Fabric Engine (aka VSP).
