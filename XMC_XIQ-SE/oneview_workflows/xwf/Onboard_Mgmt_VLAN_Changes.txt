Onboard Mgmt VLAN

v23
	- First version shared
v26
	- Added ability to set the System Name at the same time
v28
	- When workflow run second time after re-add to same site, no completion message is displayed
	- Verification of re-add XIQ-SE was not erroring as expected
v29
	- Added MAC address as device lookup in CSV file
	- A rediscovery is triggered on the newly re-added device IP, to make sure the sysname change is
	  quickly refreshed on XIQ-SE
v59
	- Added ability to change the accpeted CSV delimiter character; this can now be set in the
	  new const_CSV_DELIMITER workflow variable
	- Workflow is now able also to set the mgmt VLAN IP even if the switch initially acquired an OOB IP
	- Workflow can now be run manually with static input values without providing any CSV file
	- XIQ-SE device nickname is now cleared after re-adding device to XIQ-SE
	- Auto-sense ISIS Hello auth key can now also be changed during the mgmt IP change
	- Site and CSV variable names can now include the "-" character
	- On completion workflow now triggers device config reload via XIQ-SE API
v60
	- Function to read CSV file now tolerates empty lines in CSV file as well as spaces before/after
	  commas/values are now stripped
v61
	- Increased const_DELAY_ISISAUTH_CHANGE to default 60 secs
	- Introduced a 10 sec delay const_DELAY_RECONNECT before attempting to reconnect to device after
	  site re-add
v62
	- XIQ-SE device nickname is now set to match the provided and switch configured sysname
v63
	- Increased const_PING_NEW_IP_TIMEOUT to 20secs
	- Configuration of sysname is now performed at the beginning, before changing the switch IP and
	  deleting and re-adding the switch to XIQ-SE; this way no issue with XIQ not updating the sysname
v66
	- Added optional input for additional CLI commands
	- Added variable const_NO_ERROR_ON_FAIL_SAVE which can be enabled to prevent workflow failing if
	  a final "save config" could not be performed on the switch
	- Added variable const_AGGRESSIVE_SAVE which can be enabled to kill other CLI sessions if unable
	  to perform save config
	- Updated to latest function versions
v68
	- Added input validation for workflow to execute to make sure it is in format '<folder>/<name>'
	- Additional CLI commands now only processes commands which are not commented out
	- Additional CLI commands can now process commands with // to feed passwords to interactive prompts
	- Additional CLI commands has commented out example of how to set EDM user passwords from there
v69
	- Now checks the sflow agent IP and if it is set to the old IP, it is now changed to new IP
	- Added ability to set the XIQ-SE Device Topology Role for the device
v70
	- Added ability to set device Asset Tag under device annotation
v72
	- Workflow was failing if Mgmt VLAN Default Gateway was not set; now it can handle that case, even
	  if an unlikely deployment option
	- Added workflow variable const_GRACEFUL_EXIT_IF_NO_SN; by default False; can be set to let the
	  workflow gracefully exit if the device lookup key was not found in the provided CSV file
	- Added workflow variable const_GRACEFUL_EXIT_IF_NO_IP; by default False; can be set to let the
	  workflow gracefully exit if no Mgmt VLAN IP value was obtained from Site or CSV inputs
v73
	- A check is now performed to see if there are any auto-sense ports in state NNI-ISIS-UP, and if not
	  the workflow aborts, as there is normally no chance for it to succeed; this check can be disabled
	  via const_AUTOSENSE_NNI_CHECK
	- Small corrections to error messages
	- Default const_DELAY_SITE_READD increased to 30sec
v74
	- When deleting the switch from XIQ-SE, if it was present under NAC, it is also removed there.
	  During this process the switch is deleted from all and any Location Groups; it was found that
	  if some of those Location Groups were named using unicode characters the workflow would fail with:
	  'ascii' codec can't encode character
	  The workflow is now modified to correctly handle unicode characters during that process
v75
	- Check for auto-sense ports in state NNI-ISIS-UP is now skipped if the workflow was provided with
	  an auto-sense ISIS Auth key
v79
	- Added input for Mgmt VLAN UNI ethernet port, which allows configuring mgmt VLAN on non-fabric
	  connected switches. If the new mgmt VLAN IP is in the same subnet as the existing Onboarding VLAN IP
	  then the mgmt VLAN is added to the port untagged, else tagged
	- Check for auto-sense ports in state NNI-ISIS-UP is now replaced with a check for ISIS adjacency up
	- Parsing of CLI commands was incorrectly stripping #error pragma commands
	- Cisco velocity type #if/#elseif/#else/#end statements are now allowed in additional CLI commands box
v81
	- If a Mgmt VLAN Port is supplied, and if the mgmt VLAN is to be assigned to that port as tagged, the
	  Onboarding VLAN will be added as untagged and as Promiscuous to the same port; this can be controlled
	  via variable const_ONBVLAN_ON_TAGD_MGMTPORT which is by default true
v82
	- Increased const_PING_NEW_IP_TIMEOUT to 45 secs, while testing new Mgmt VLAN Port input
v83
	- Fix to CLI regex pattern to capture VLAN ids and associated I-SIDs
v84
	- Setting a mgmt VLAN UNI ethernet port was failing if the mgmt VLAN was already existing on the switch
v85
	- Setting a mgmt VLAN UNI ethernet port was failing if the mgmt VLAN was already existing on the switch
	  for a different reason
v92
	- CSV parsing code is now forgiving with invalid CSV files where an entry has less records than declared in the top row
	- Fixed bug on error messages which would only display if failing to delete the switch from XIQ-SE or Access Control
v96
	- Error messages in case of NBI mutations now display LastNbiError
	- Added variable const_EXPORT_EMC_VARS which can be populated with emc_vars keys to make available
	  in ${<varname>} variables, with special treatment of keys "deviceIP" & "deviceName" which will be
	  set to the target VLAN mgmt IP and System name; these variables can be used in the Additional
	  CLI commands input box
	- Sometimes emc_vars['deviceSoftwareVer'] is not available after ZTP+ onboarding; workflow now
	  gets version from switch directly if that happens instead of failing
	- When run with optional UNI static port, summary of executed commands no longer includes the TFTP file transfer,
	  cat and execution
	- Added variable const_FOLLOW_WORKFLOW_DELAY to be able to add a delay before calling follow on
	  workflow
v98
	- Added support for path variables %rootDir%, %sitePath% and %siteName% on CSV file input
	- Ability to parse #if/#elseif/#else/#end, #eval, #sleep, #last statements in additional CLI commands input
	- Timer const_DELAY_RECONNECT increased from 10 to 15sec
v100 - posted
	- If an auto-sense ISIS Hello auth key is provided, the workflow now only proceeds if it sees auto-sense
	  interfaces in state NNI-AUTH-FAIL, otherwise it delays execution up to expiry of const_NO_NNI_ISIS_AUTH_DELAY
	  (default 300sec); the NNI-AUTH-FAIL is new in VOSS 9.1.1.0, so this check & delay will only happen if the
	  switch software version is 9.1.1.0 or later; for earlier software versions nothing has changed, but setting
	  the ISIS auth key on them will remain best effort and typically will only work if the onboarding switch is
	  directly connected to the core/distribution; for fabric "stacks" 9.1.1.0 is required with above changes.
