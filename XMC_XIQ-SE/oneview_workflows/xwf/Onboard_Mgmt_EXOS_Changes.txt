Onboard Mgmt EXOS

v3
	- First version shared; forked from Onboard Mgmt VLAN v92
v13
	- Lots of bug fixes!
v15
	- Added logic to change the IP address on the same existing mgmt VLAN
	- Also added logic for replicing the untagged VLAN on optional UNI static port
v16
	- Implemented const_NO_ERROR_ON_FAIL_SAVE
v22
	- Setting a UNI access port input is now mutually exclusive with setting a VLAN I-SID
	- After setting the VLAN I-SID, workflow now waits for that binding to be active before proceeding
v29
	- Error messages in case of NBI mutations now display LastNbiError
	- Creation of new mgmt VLAN IP, Gateway and removal of existing mgmt IP and gateway are now done
	  via TFTP script
	- Added variable const_EXPORT_EMC_VARS which can be populated with emc_vars keys to make available
	  in ${<varname>} variables, with special treatment of keys "deviceIP" & "deviceName" which will be
	  set to the target VLAN mgmt IP and System name; these variables can be used in the Additional
	  CLI commands input box
	- FA Message Authentication input combo now has variable inputs
	- On EXOS switches which do not support mirror from auto-source-ip, the app-telemetry EAN ERSPAN
	  mirror is deleted and re-created using the new mgmt VLAN IP as from IP
	- Sometimes emc_vars['deviceSoftwareVer'] is not available after ZTP+ onboarding; workflow now
	  gets version from switch directly if that happens instead of failing
v37
	- Summary of executed commands no longer includes the TFTP file transfer, cat and execution
	- Added variable const_FOLLOW_WORKFLOW_DELAY to be able to add a delay before calling follow on
	  workflow
	- Workflow was failing in Sanity mode waiting for FA I-SID to become active
v38
	- Message printing delay to execute follow on workflow was printing the wrong timer
v42 - posted
	- CSV parsing code is now forgiving with invalid CSV files where an entry has less records than declared in the top row
	- Added support for path variables %rootDir%, %sitePath% and %siteName% on CSV file input
	- Ability to parse #if/#elseif/#else/#end, #eval, #sleep, #last statements in additional CLI commands input
	- Timer const_DELAY_RECONNECT increased from 10 to 15sec
